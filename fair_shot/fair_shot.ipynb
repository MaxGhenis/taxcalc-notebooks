    "# Analysis of Chris Hughes' \"Fair Shot\" Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of cash transfer plan proposed by Chris Hughes in his 2018 book, [*FAIR SHOT: Rethinking Inequality and How We Earn*](http://www.fairshotbook.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Per [Felix Salmon's review](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/books/review/chris-hughes-fair-shot.html) (summarized in my [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/MaxGhenis/status/968216600670171136)), the elements of the plan are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) \\$6k/year paid monthly to each adult in a household with income between \\$6k-\\$50k in previous year, or who earned <\\$50k but (a) had cared for a dependent under age six or over age 70, or (b) were enrolled in an accredited college.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Households earning <\\$6k in past year and who don't meet dependent or college requirements get their previous year's earnings matched 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Funded by increasing to 50% the marginal rate on income and capital gains for households earning above \\$250k.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tax-Calculator CPS data ([documentation](http://open-source-economics.github.io/Tax-Calculator/)) lacks certain data elements necessary to fully implement this, so we make simplifying assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No ages of child dependents.** Instead flag tax units with at least one person under age 18 (`nu18 > 0`).\n",
    "* **No ages of elderly parent dependents.** Instead flag all tax units that claimed an elderly parent as a dependent (`elderly_dependent`, which has [no age threshold](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/family/steps-to-claiming-an-elderly-parent-as-a-dependent/L34jePeT9)).\n",
    "* **No college enrollment**, so flag tax units with nonzero education tax credits (`c07230 > 0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential child care fields include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `e32800`: \"Child/dependent-care expenses for qualifying persons from Form 2441\"\n",
    "* `f2441`: \"number of child/dependent-care qualifying persons\"\n",
    "* `c07180`: \"Credit for child and dependent care expenses from Form 2441\"\n",
